- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

If something is wrong in a parent class, it has to be fixed there rather than in any of the child classes to resolve the issue, which shows that the child classes inherit everything from their parents unless you give them individual attributes as well.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The House class was probably the easiest because all of the methods were fairly short and straightforward, while the Cafe class, for example, actually took longer because I had to make sure I was getting all of the pieces together for the restock to work properly. I'd say to start with what is "easier" to you and then move on from there.
